# Angular Tutorial

This is based on the [Getting started with Angular](https://angular.io/start) guide. 

## :exclamation: TODOs for this README

- [ ] Explain how to setup and run the project referencing the original tutorial and where to substitute things here
- [ ] Explain how to create components and services when it asks you to in the tutorial to use the StackBlitz special menus, we want to demonstrate using `ng generate` commands here.
- [ ] Rubric/grading things?
- [ ] Using the GH Classroom feedback PR


## Setup

Like in previous labs, click "Install All" to automatically install them.

## Running your project

The first time you run your Angular project, you will need to run `npm install` so that all the dependencies managed by npm will be installed. Once you have successfully run `npm install`, in order to serve up the project, you will type 
**`ng serve`**. This will trigger the various tools in the
client side portion of the project to build and host your client side
application on their own little web-server, available by default at [`localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200/). If the development server is running, you will be able to see the 

When you open it in the browser you should be greeted with something that looks like this:
